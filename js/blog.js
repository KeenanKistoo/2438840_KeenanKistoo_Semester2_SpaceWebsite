      Blog Post #01 - Close Reading: Overview of Data Visualisation
    </h3>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      This chapter delves into the depth of "The Concept of Data
      Visualization" (Li, 2020: 17). It provides several different
      definitions, or rather, understandings of what data visualization can
      be perceived as. Additionally, this chapter also discusses the
      different forms that we can consider as a visualization of data.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      Each definition differed slightly; however, the central idea shared
      among many was that data visualization is a method of presenting data
      to individuals more efficiently, making it easier to comprehend. When
      looking into this concept further, it is split into two aspects:
      “information visualization and scientific visualization” (Li, 2020:
      19). However, regardless of the division, the data provided needs to
      be illustrated in an effective way to allow individuals to understand
      it. My understanding of this is that even though the language used in
      data sets, spreadsheets, bank statements, and so on, may or may not be
      complicated, the substantial number of values may be difficult to
      understand in their “raw” form (Li, 2020: 19).
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      “Trees” allow data to be displayed to depict importance, structure,
      time stamps, evolution/growth, or any related instance (Li, 2020: 24).
      For example, in Figure 1, there is a clear “hierarchical” (Li, 2020:
      24) flow to the “skill tree” (FIFA 23, 2022). The locked icon of the
      tree that is marked A cannot be unlocked unless a series of other
      branches is unlocked first. The structure is evident and allows the
      user, in this instance, the player, to view their progression
      accordingly. This form of data visualisation is not a conventional
      example like a food chain or a family tree, but it shows progression
      and importance, which is a fundamental concept of this data
      visualisation form.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      “Maps” are scaled illustrations of a particular location (in a
      geographical context) or a representation of an aspect, concept,
      program, or object (Li, 2020: 26). This is a concept that should be
      easy to understand theoretically since we are exposed to so many, but
      still, I struggled to grasp it due to the idea that anything can be
      mapped out. For example, “DNA mapping” and Google Maps are
      fundamentally different however, both can be classified as a form of a
      map (Li, 2020: 26). The difference is that a DNA map uses a
      microscopic scale (this increases the magnification) whereas a map of
      Johannesburg needs to be scaled down to cover the entire space.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      “Tables” allow for information of distinct types to be displayed in
      one space (Li, 2020: 30). I do think that there is a common
      misconception that using tables as a data visualisation form refers to
      an excessive number of values that are all placed within rows and
      columns. Tables can display text, numbers, check boxes, images, and
      any other form of data that needs to be compared between various
      categories. For example, in Figure 2, we see the classes (all the text
      under headings, which one may interpret as the data types that are
      being compared) and their corresponding numerical values, whereas, in
      Figure 3, the numerical values are used to distinguish the data types
      that are being compared and text is the data that is being displayed.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      “Graphs” allow multiple numerical values of a specific or multiple
      category/s to be displayed visually using lines, bars, and so on (Li,
      2020: 34). To some extent, I do think that graphs can be altered or
      “inaccurate” as the individual/s generating the graph can alter the
      scale or axis to suit the strategy that they are trying to achieve
      (Li, 2020: 35); even though the values may be correct, the
      representation of these values may create a false sense of
      understanding by the viewers. It is important to represent information
      honestly and ethically.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      There are attributes inherent in “traditional data visualisations”
      (Li, 2020: 41). The focus of the data visualisation should be on what
      is being displayed and not on how it is being said. The viewer should
      easily differentiate between different values, headings, colours, and
      so on. Yes, graphs, scatter plots, and even maps can be challenging to
      comprehend, however, once the viewer develops a firm grasp of the data
      visualisation form, they should easily read the data. The data
      visualisation should rely on recall and relevancy. It should also act
      as an aid to understanding the data sets.

    <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Conclusion</h4>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      During my first attempt at understanding what data visualisation is, I
      found myself confusing the use of art to represent or explain a
      concept with data visualisation. After completing this reading, I do
      think I am in a better position to move forward with my website. When
      planning this blog post, I set out to write fifty words and an
      additional example of each data visualisation form. After actually
      engaging with the reading, various templates, and websites, I found
      myself lost in endless possibilities. I have proceeded to select a few
      data visualisation forms that I am most likely to use during the
      development of my website.

    Blog Post #02 - Critical Reflection - My Proposed UI and UX
  </h3>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    My overall objective is to create a website that effectively allows
    the user to navigate through it and convey the theme that was set out
    for us. More importantly, I am hoping that with the first iteration of
    this website, I have improved and learned from my previous mistakes.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Colour Palette/Choice:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I have opted for a black-and-white colour palette with random bursts
    of colour. I believe that these random bursts of colour will draw the
    user to important information and guide them along with my future data
    visualisation additions. At the time of writing, there are no data
    visualisations yet, and my entire website is in black and white.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Homepage</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I tend to put a lot of thought, sometimes too much thought, into my
    homepage and I struggle to find the balance between too little
    information and an unnecessary amount of information. I have opted for
    a very basic homepage and have found the perfect image for what I was
    trying to accomplish.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    On my website, there is an image of an astronaut looking up giving the
    impression of the astronaut staring at the heading and navigation bar.
    At first, I thought this was a really neat idea but felt it was just
    too little information for the user. The astronaut guides the user to
    where I want them to look first however, the headings provide too
    little information about my website.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    For example, some of the pages on my website are about Mars, The
    Kepler Field, and The Picture of the Day. The headings give an overall
    idea of what will be on the webpage however, it does not specify
    considering the various content that could possibly be about Mars or
    The Kepler Field. I have decided to implement a tooltip that appears
    when the user hovers over one of the buttons (or headings) and gives
    them more information about the page that follows. This tooltip
    disappears when the user's mouse leaves the button. This allows me to
    ensure the clean and uncluttered homepage that I desired but still
    allows the user to gain more information on the website.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Navigation Bar:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    This is consistent throughout my website. I believe that the homepage
    acts as a tutorial of some sort. Keeping this idea in mind, I hope to
    allow my users to identify how my navigation bar works when first
    interacting with it and from that point onwards their navigation
    experience will be easier.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I do however think that the transition speeds when hovering and when
    the tooltip appears are too quick. It feels more like a flash rather
    than a transition. I noticed this before submission however I could
    not bring my mind to deciding the correct value of time. My idea
    moving forward would be to sit with a few friends and alter the time
    slightly each time and get some feedback; thereafter, I will decide on
    what works best.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Blog Page:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    My blog section is split into two parts. The quick access panel acts
    as a table of contents. For some context, my data visualization idea
    would be an illustration of the Earth rotating around the sun. My
    concern is that this constant motion would become annoying for the
    user. Hence, the table of contents is labelled as a quick access panel
    as I would like to allow the user to have a choice: 1) Interact with
    my data visualization idea to navigate to the desired blog post or 2)
    click on the blog post heading in the quick access panel. Also, I have
    tested the visual illustration with no interactivity and I would like
    to make sure that there is a backup navigation if there are any
    unforeseen errors.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I have also decided to add all my blog posts on one page. The goal is
    to have everything under one section in one place. For navigating and
    user experience purposes, I do think that scrolling to the top of the
    page to access information would be easier than going back to a
    previous tab. Currently, on my website, there is a flaw with this
    idea: when I add this blog post, the user will need to scroll far up
    to access the access bar or the navigation bar. I would like to either
    add a scroll to the top button on the page and/or have the access bar
    as a slide-out menu to improve the user experience.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Design Section/Blog Post:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    These two sections follow a very simple idea. Heading > Divider line >
    Paragraph. I kept this constant throughout both sections to ensure
    that the user knew how to read everything from experience. The idea is
    to have the user see the heading in a larger font, gain some sort of
    idea as to what they are going to read next, and then read the text
    below. I personally do not like blog pages that are in a
    newspaper/magazine format (with columns, an enlarged first letter of
    the paragraph, etc.), I just feel like a more linear structure is a
    more effective way to communicate thoughts. Once the user reads
    certain information, they can move on from it as it is not slightly
    left of a column divider for example. The planet-themed divider line
    was added to keep up with the theme of the website.
  </p>
  <img
    class="planet-div-line"
    src="../images/div-line-planets-new.jpg"
    alt="Planets Divider Line"
  />
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">What my website lacks:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    A footer. I have added this to my code but not implemented it into the
    website. I do think that this allows users who are at the end of a
    page to navigate back to a different page or back to the top of the
    page.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    This brings me to my next point: I would like to add a button that is
    set to active when my user reaches the bottom of the page to return to
    the top of the page.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I do think that the small additions that make the user's life easier
    are what make a website more likely to succeed. It shows the user that
    the developer cares about their experience and would like to make it
    as smooth as possible.

  Blog Post 3 - Close Reading - Interaction for Data Visualisation
</h3>
<p class="blog-txt">
  My working description of interaction within a web-based medium
  refers to the dynamic collaboration between different elements. On
  one side, there is the user who engages with the web interface using
  their input devices (such as a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen) and
  the underlying hardware and software of their device. On the other
  side, there is the developer who has created the user interface that
  facilitates this interaction. Together, they work to exchange
  specific information seamlessly, allowing users to navigate, access,
  and interact with content or services on the web. Interactive data
  visualisations are always complicated to create for several reasons.
  Firstly, there is no clear or standard definition of “interaction”
  as pointed out by Dimara and Perin (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 1). But
  also, subjectivity plays a crucial role in the success of one’s data
  visualisations. There is always this probable scenario that some
  individuals may not fully understand the interactivity that you have
  implemented into the visualisations or they simply do not understand
  the data that is being displayed; this is something that I struggle
  with in my work and hopefully, after completing this reflection I
  find ways to improve my understanding and methods of creating
  interactive data visualisations.
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  In the second section, the authors delve into their approach to
  gathering definitions, concepts, ideas, and opinions related to
  interaction, which primarily involves conducting surveys. They rated
  their responses on a scale ranging from 1 to 2 (1 being less
  in-depth, descriptive, and so on; and 2 being more in-depth
  explanations and/or opinions) (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3). Each
  response was “tagged” according to certain “themes” (Dimara & Perin,
  2019: 3). I would like to extend on my working description of
  interaction and attempt to meet the expectations set forth by the
  authors according to their tags: “definition of interaction,
  critical on interaction, benefits of interaction” (Dimara & Perin,
  2019: 3).
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">Definition of Interaction:</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  “Interaction within a web-based medium refers to the dynamic
  collaboration between different elements. On one side, there is the
  user who engages with the web interface using their input devices
  (such as a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen) and the underlying
  hardware and software of their device. On the other side, there is
  the developer who has created the user interface that facilitates
  this interaction. Together, they work to exchange specific
  information seamlessly, allowing users to navigate, access, and
  interact with content or services on the web.” – mentioned above.
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Critical on Interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  To reiterate the subjectivity point, one cannot account for every
  individual’s levels of comprehension and understanding. Yes, one can
  argue that tutorials and explanations may help new users understand
  the interactive portions of a website however, too much information
  could create a lack of faith in one’s data visualization creation
  capabilities. The balance between too much and too little
  information is a nuanced and complex matter which I find very
  difficult to manage as an individual who has minimal experience with
  interactive data visualizations.
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Benefits of Interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  It creates a more hands-on experience for the user and allows them
  to control what is communicated to them provided the website’s
  interface elements allow them to. This intended experience allows
  users to be more engaged on the website. From previous experiences,
  I have often been told that I should show and not tell. In the cases
  where I am successful in this, specifically concerning my navigation
  interface, I find that navigating through my website becomes much
  easier for the user.
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  Now moving on to the third section of the reading, “What Interaction
  for Visualization Must Involve” based on my definition of
  interaction: the user and the data described can be identified as
  “external entities” (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3-4). Regarding the
  "external actions," it's quite interesting how the authors
  characterize interaction as "dialogue" (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 4). A
  rudimentary understanding of dialogue would two or more individuals
  communicating with each other. In this case, however, it is the
  communication between the “user and the visualisation system”
  through interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3-4). I understand this
  relationship as a form of communication between said “external
  entities” (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3-4). It also emphasises that the
  “visualisation system” relies on these “entities” to function
  accordingly (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3-4).
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  Before I move on, I believe that it is important to differentiate
  between “the terms related to interaction” (Dimara & Perin, 2019:
  5):
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Interaction vs. Interaction Technique (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 5):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  “Interaction” is the overarching idea of how the “user” interacts
  with the “visualisation system” (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 5).
  “Interaction Technique,” on the other hand, is the elements that
  allow the user to interact with the “visualisation system”; for
  example, the mouse, keyboard, touchpad, touchscreen, or any relevant
  “hardware/software” (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 5).
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Science of Interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 5):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  The academic approach to acquiring knowledge and understanding
  interacts with the overall goal of improving this concept (Dimara &
  Perin, 2019: 5). The authors point out that interaction is used to
  “amplify cognition in active, human-driven data exploration” (Dimara
  & Perin, 2019: 5). The “science” that I am referring to will allow
  individuals to create interactive data visualizations that are
  better understood globally; this somewhat standardized method of
  creation will limit the subjectivity critique that I have previously
  mentioned.
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  Before I conclude, I'd like to provide a summary and share my
  perspective on the relationship between interaction in visualisation
  and the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) (Dimara & Perin,
  2019: 6-7).
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Scope of User Intent (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 6):
</h4>

<p class="blog-txt">
  The authors argue that the interaction that takes place should be
  easier to navigate and efficient. The user should be able to achieve
  their intended goal when entering the website quickly and without
  having to worry about confusing and overly elaborate interactions.
  To add to this, I do think that consistency is a crucial aspect of
  user intent and experience. If the created interactions are
  consistent throughout the website, there is no need for repetitive
  and excessive explanations.
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  User Profiling (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 7):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  In HCI, this refers to the knowledge and skills of different groups
  of individuals who have access to the website. For example, how well
  or poorly can a beginner/lower-skilled individual interact with your
  visualisations? Or is there too much unnecessary information for
  individuals who have already interacted with your visualisations
  before?
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  What Constitutes Good Interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 7):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  The authors argue that good interactions differ from HCI (Dimara &
  Perin, 2019: 7). Rather, good interactions improve and enhance the
  user’s understanding of the data. I would argue that good
  interactions also include the responsiveness and smoothness of
  interface elements within the visualisations. By smoothness, I’m
  implying the speed of pop-ups or colour changes, animation
  transitions, and all related elements.
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  In conclusion, it is important to note that interaction is a complex
  concept that differs for different data sets as well as audiences. I
  have often emphasized the ridiculously fine line between a balanced
  and efficient interface system and I do think that guidelines will
  improve our understanding of this term, however, the systems will be
  constantly changing due to how unique each individual is. I have
  found within the feedback that I have received that it is often
  minor details that separate good interactions from frustrating ones.
