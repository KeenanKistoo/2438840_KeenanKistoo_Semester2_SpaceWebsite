      Blog Post #01 - Close Reading: Overview of Data Visualisation
    </h3>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      This chapter delves into the depth of "The Concept of Data
      Visualization" (Li, 2020: 17). It provides several different
      definitions, or rather, understandings of what data visualization can
      be perceived as. Additionally, this chapter also discusses the
      different forms that we can consider as a visualization of data.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      Each definition differed slightly; however, the central idea shared
      among many was that data visualization is a method of presenting data
      to individuals more efficiently, making it easier to comprehend. When
      looking into this concept further, it is split into two aspects:
      “information visualization and scientific visualization” (Li, 2020:
      19). However, regardless of the division, the data provided needs to
      be illustrated in an effective way to allow individuals to understand
      it. My understanding of this is that even though the language used in
      data sets, spreadsheets, bank statements, and so on, may or may not be
      complicated, the substantial number of values may be difficult to
      understand in their “raw” form (Li, 2020: 19).
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      “Trees” allow data to be displayed to depict importance, structure,
      time stamps, evolution/growth, or any related instance (Li, 2020: 24).
      For example, in Figure 1, there is a clear “hierarchical” (Li, 2020:
      24) flow to the “skill tree” (FIFA 23, 2022). The locked icon of the
      tree that is marked A cannot be unlocked unless a series of other
      branches is unlocked first. The structure is evident and allows the
      user, in this instance, the player, to view their progression
      accordingly. This form of data visualisation is not a conventional
      example like a food chain or a family tree, but it shows progression
      and importance, which is a fundamental concept of this data
      visualisation form.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      “Maps” are scaled illustrations of a particular location (in a
      geographical context) or a representation of an aspect, concept,
      program, or object (Li, 2020: 26). This is a concept that should be
      easy to understand theoretically since we are exposed to so many, but
      still, I struggled to grasp it due to the idea that anything can be
      mapped out. For example, “DNA mapping” and Google Maps are
      fundamentally different however, both can be classified as a form of a
      map (Li, 2020: 26). The difference is that a DNA map uses a
      microscopic scale (this increases the magnification) whereas a map of
      Johannesburg needs to be scaled down to cover the entire space.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      “Tables” allow for information of distinct types to be displayed in
      one space (Li, 2020: 30). I do think that there is a common
      misconception that using tables as a data visualisation form refers to
      an excessive number of values that are all placed within rows and
      columns. Tables can display text, numbers, check boxes, images, and
      any other form of data that needs to be compared between various
      categories. For example, in Figure 2, we see the classes (all the text
      under headings, which one may interpret as the data types that are
      being compared) and their corresponding numerical values, whereas, in
      Figure 3, the numerical values are used to distinguish the data types
      that are being compared and text is the data that is being displayed.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      “Graphs” allow multiple numerical values of a specific or multiple
      category/s to be displayed visually using lines, bars, and so on (Li,
      2020: 34). To some extent, I do think that graphs can be altered or
      “inaccurate” as the individual/s generating the graph can alter the
      scale or axis to suit the strategy that they are trying to achieve
      (Li, 2020: 35); even though the values may be correct, the
      representation of these values may create a false sense of
      understanding by the viewers. It is important to represent information
      honestly and ethically.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      There are attributes inherent in “traditional data visualisations”
      (Li, 2020: 41). The focus of the data visualisation should be on what
      is being displayed and not on how it is being said. The viewer should
      easily differentiate between different values, headings, colours, and
      so on. Yes, graphs, scatter plots, and even maps can be challenging to
      comprehend, however, once the viewer develops a firm grasp of the data
      visualisation form, they should easily read the data. The data
      visualisation should rely on recall and relevancy. It should also act
      as an aid to understanding the data sets.

    <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Conclusion</h4>
    <p class="blog-txt">
      During my first attempt at understanding what data visualisation is, I
      found myself confusing the use of art to represent or explain a
      concept with data visualisation. After completing this reading, I do
      think I am in a better position to move forward with my website. When
      planning this blog post, I set out to write fifty words and an
      additional example of each data visualisation form. After actually
      engaging with the reading, various templates, and websites, I found
      myself lost in endless possibilities. I have proceeded to select a few
      data visualisation forms that I am most likely to use during the
      development of my website.

    Blog Post #02 - Critical Reflection - My Proposed UI and UX
  </h3>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    My overall objective is to create a website that effectively allows
    the user to navigate through it and convey the theme that was set out
    for us. More importantly, I am hoping that with the first iteration of
    this website, I have improved and learned from my previous mistakes.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Colour Palette/Choice:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I have opted for a black-and-white colour palette with random bursts
    of colour. I believe that these random bursts of colour will draw the
    user to important information and guide them along with my future data
    visualisation additions. At the time of writing, there are no data
    visualisations yet, and my entire website is in black and white.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Homepage</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I tend to put a lot of thought, sometimes too much thought, into my
    homepage and I struggle to find the balance between too little
    information and an unnecessary amount of information. I have opted for
    a very basic homepage and have found the perfect image for what I was
    trying to accomplish.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    On my website, there is an image of an astronaut looking up giving the
    impression of the astronaut staring at the heading and navigation bar.
    At first, I thought this was a really neat idea but felt it was just
    too little information for the user. The astronaut guides the user to
    where I want them to look first however, the headings provide too
    little information about my website.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    For example, some of the pages on my website are about Mars, The
    Kepler Field, and The Picture of the Day. The headings give an overall
    idea of what will be on the webpage however, it does not specify
    considering the various content that could possibly be about Mars or
    The Kepler Field. I have decided to implement a tooltip that appears
    when the user hovers over one of the buttons (or headings) and gives
    them more information about the page that follows. This tooltip
    disappears when the user's mouse leaves the button. This allows me to
    ensure the clean and uncluttered homepage that I desired but still
    allows the user to gain more information on the website.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Navigation Bar:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    This is consistent throughout my website. I believe that the homepage
    acts as a tutorial of some sort. Keeping this idea in mind, I hope to
    allow my users to identify how my navigation bar works when first
    interacting with it and from that point onwards their navigation
    experience will be easier.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I do however think that the transition speeds when hovering and when
    the tooltip appears are too quick. It feels more like a flash rather
    than a transition. I noticed this before submission however I could
    not bring my mind to deciding the correct value of time. My idea
    moving forward would be to sit with a few friends and alter the time
    slightly each time and get some feedback; thereafter, I will decide on
    what works best.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Blog Page:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    My blog section is split into two parts. The quick access panel acts
    as a table of contents. For some context, my data visualization idea
    would be an illustration of the Earth rotating around the sun. My
    concern is that this constant motion would become annoying for the
    user. Hence, the table of contents is labelled as a quick access panel
    as I would like to allow the user to have a choice: 1) Interact with
    my data visualization idea to navigate to the desired blog post or 2)
    click on the blog post heading in the quick access panel. Also, I have
    tested the visual illustration with no interactivity and I would like
    to make sure that there is a backup navigation if there are any
    unforeseen errors.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I have also decided to add all my blog posts on one page. The goal is
    to have everything under one section in one place. For navigating and
    user experience purposes, I do think that scrolling to the top of the
    page to access information would be easier than going back to a
    previous tab. Currently, on my website, there is a flaw with this
    idea: when I add this blog post, the user will need to scroll far up
    to access the access bar or the navigation bar. I would like to either
    add a scroll to the top button on the page and/or have the access bar
    as a slide-out menu to improve the user experience.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Design Section/Blog Post:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    These two sections follow a very simple idea. Heading > Divider line >
    Paragraph. I kept this constant throughout both sections to ensure
    that the user knew how to read everything from experience. The idea is
    to have the user see the heading in a larger font, gain some sort of
    idea as to what they are going to read next, and then read the text
    below. I personally do not like blog pages that are in a
    newspaper/magazine format (with columns, an enlarged first letter of
    the paragraph, etc.), I just feel like a more linear structure is a
    more effective way to communicate thoughts. Once the user reads
    certain information, they can move on from it as it is not slightly
    left of a column divider for example. The planet-themed divider line
    was added to keep up with the theme of the website.
  </p>
  <img
    class="planet-div-line"
    src="../images/div-line-planets-new.jpg"
    alt="Planets Divider Line"
  />
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">What my website lacks:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    A footer. I have added this to my code but not implemented it into the
    website. I do think that this allows users who are at the end of a
    page to navigate back to a different page or back to the top of the
    page.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    This brings me to my next point: I would like to add a button that is
    set to active when my user reaches the bottom of the page to return to
    the top of the page.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I do think that the small additions that make the user's life easier
    are what make a website more likely to succeed. It shows the user that
    the developer cares about their experience and would like to make it
    as smooth as possible.

  Blog Post 3 - Close Reading - Interaction for Data Visualisation
</h3>
<p class="blog-txt">
  My working description of interaction within a web-based medium
  refers to the dynamic collaboration between different elements. On
  one side, there is the user who engages with the web interface using
  their input devices (such as a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen) and
  the underlying hardware and software of their device. On the other
  side, there is the developer who has created the user interface that
  facilitates this interaction. Together, they work to exchange
  specific information seamlessly, allowing users to navigate, access,
  and interact with content or services on the web. Interactive data
  visualisations are always complicated to create for several reasons.
  Firstly, there is no clear or standard definition of “interaction”
  as pointed out by Dimara and Perin (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 1). But
  also, subjectivity plays a crucial role in the success of one’s data
  visualisations. There is always this probable scenario that some
  individuals may not fully understand the interactivity that you have
  implemented into the visualisations or they simply do not understand
  the data that is being displayed; this is something that I struggle
  with in my work and hopefully, after completing this reflection I
  find ways to improve my understanding and methods of creating
  interactive data visualisations.
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  In the second section, the authors delve into their approach to
  gathering definitions, concepts, ideas, and opinions related to
  interaction, which primarily involves conducting surveys. They rated
  their responses on a scale ranging from 1 to 2 (1 being less
  in-depth, descriptive, and so on; and 2 being more in-depth
  explanations and/or opinions) (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3). Each
  response was “tagged” according to certain “themes” (Dimara & Perin,
  2019: 3). I would like to extend on my working description of
  interaction and attempt to meet the expectations set forth by the
  authors according to their tags: “definition of interaction,
  critical on interaction, benefits of interaction” (Dimara & Perin,
  2019: 3).
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">Definition of Interaction:</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  “Interaction within a web-based medium refers to the dynamic
  collaboration between different elements. On one side, there is the
  user who engages with the web interface using their input devices
  (such as a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen) and the underlying
  hardware and software of their device. On the other side, there is
  the developer who has created the user interface that facilitates
  this interaction. Together, they work to exchange specific
  information seamlessly, allowing users to navigate, access, and
  interact with content or services on the web.” – mentioned above.
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Critical on Interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  To reiterate the subjectivity point, one cannot account for every
  individual’s levels of comprehension and understanding. Yes, one can
  argue that tutorials and explanations may help new users understand
  the interactive portions of a website however, too much information
  could create a lack of faith in one’s data visualization creation
  capabilities. The balance between too much and too little
  information is a nuanced and complex matter which I find very
  difficult to manage as an individual who has minimal experience with
  interactive data visualizations.
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Benefits of Interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  It creates a more hands-on experience for the user and allows them
  to control what is communicated to them provided the website’s
  interface elements allow them to. This intended experience allows
  users to be more engaged on the website. From previous experiences,
  I have often been told that I should show and not tell. In the cases
  where I am successful in this, specifically concerning my navigation
  interface, I find that navigating through my website becomes much
  easier for the user.
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  Now moving on to the third section of the reading, “What Interaction
  for Visualization Must Involve” based on my definition of
  interaction: the user and the data described can be identified as
  “external entities” (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3-4). Regarding the
  "external actions," it's quite interesting how the authors
  characterize interaction as "dialogue" (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 4). A
  rudimentary understanding of dialogue would two or more individuals
  communicating with each other. In this case, however, it is the
  communication between the “user and the visualisation system”
  through interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3-4). I understand this
  relationship as a form of communication between said “external
  entities” (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3-4). It also emphasises that the
  “visualisation system” relies on these “entities” to function
  accordingly (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 3-4).
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  Before I move on, I believe that it is important to differentiate
  between “the terms related to interaction” (Dimara & Perin, 2019:
  5):
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Interaction vs. Interaction Technique (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 5):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  “Interaction” is the overarching idea of how the “user” interacts
  with the “visualisation system” (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 5).
  “Interaction Technique,” on the other hand, is the elements that
  allow the user to interact with the “visualisation system”; for
  example, the mouse, keyboard, touchpad, touchscreen, or any relevant
  “hardware/software” (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 5).
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Science of Interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 5):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  The academic approach to acquiring knowledge and understanding
  interacts with the overall goal of improving this concept (Dimara &
  Perin, 2019: 5). The authors point out that interaction is used to
  “amplify cognition in active, human-driven data exploration” (Dimara
  & Perin, 2019: 5). The “science” that I am referring to will allow
  individuals to create interactive data visualizations that are
  better understood globally; this somewhat standardized method of
  creation will limit the subjectivity critique that I have previously
  mentioned.
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  Before I conclude, I'd like to provide a summary and share my
  perspective on the relationship between interaction in visualisation
  and the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) (Dimara & Perin,
  2019: 6-7).
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  Scope of User Intent (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 6):
</h4>

<p class="blog-txt">
  The authors argue that the interaction that takes place should be
  easier to navigate and efficient. The user should be able to achieve
  their intended goal when entering the website quickly and without
  having to worry about confusing and overly elaborate interactions.
  To add to this, I do think that consistency is a crucial aspect of
  user intent and experience. If the created interactions are
  consistent throughout the website, there is no need for repetitive
  and excessive explanations.
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  User Profiling (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 7):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  In HCI, this refers to the knowledge and skills of different groups
  of individuals who have access to the website. For example, how well
  or poorly can a beginner/lower-skilled individual interact with your
  visualisations? Or is there too much unnecessary information for
  individuals who have already interacted with your visualisations
  before?
</p>
<h4 class="sub-head-blog">
  What Constitutes Good Interaction (Dimara & Perin, 2019: 7):
</h4>
<p class="blog-txt">
  The authors argue that good interactions differ from HCI (Dimara &
  Perin, 2019: 7). Rather, good interactions improve and enhance the
  user’s understanding of the data. I would argue that good
  interactions also include the responsiveness and smoothness of
  interface elements within the visualisations. By smoothness, I’m
  implying the speed of pop-ups or colour changes, animation
  transitions, and all related elements.
</p>
<p class="blog-txt">
  In conclusion, it is important to note that interaction is a complex
  concept that differs for different data sets as well as audiences. I
  have often emphasized the ridiculously fine line between a balanced
  and efficient interface system and I do think that guidelines will
  improve our understanding of this term, however, the systems will be
  constantly changing due to how unique each individual is. I have
  found within the feedback that I have received that it is often
  minor details that separate good interactions from frustrating ones.

  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">My Thought Process:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I had a significant concern regarding the repetitive nature of my
    game. Originally, I envisioned the game lasting approximately 12
    minutes, with each in-game hour taking up 30 seconds. The idea was
    to create a sense of realism where players would experience a
    job-like routine, waiting for solar flares to occur.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    However, I decided against this approach for several reasons.
    Firstly, the core mechanics were overly repetitive, and I was
    concerned that players might lose interest quickly. Additionally,
    the overlap of certain solar flare bursts presented a challenge. To
    address this issue, I attempted to create an algorithm that would
    select only one of the two overlapping solar flares. While this
    approach reduced redundancy, it also meant there would be fewer
    solar flares throughout the 12-minute gameplay. As a result, players
    would find themselves in a waiting period, merely watching a
    countdown, which wasn't engaging.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I ultimately decided to shift away from a purely realistic approach
    and instead incorporated time as a key difficulty element in the
    game. Given that the time and source location needed to remain
    consistent for players to answer questions accurately, it became
    apparent that a difficulty curve was necessary to keep the game
    engaging.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    In this new approach, I introduced a time limit for each round,
    which would progressively decrease with each subsequent round. This
    time constraint added a layer of challenge and urgency to the game.
    The concept behind this adjustment was to reflect the idea that a
    more experienced player or individual would be quicker in completing
    a given task, while a less experienced one might take slightly
    longer; I preferred this more subtle realism approach instead of my
    previous idea.

  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Replayability:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    At the time of writing, my game’s user interface and timer are
    complete and my code is sorting the data as planned and discussed
    above; but there is no actual functionality implemented yet and this
    is something I am concerned about. Initially, I asked to use the
    three.js library but after careful consideration, I realized that I
    was forcing a complex idea that had little chance of being
    successful.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Before I continue, I'd like to provide more detail about the
    inspiration behind "The Impossible Quiz." This quiz is designed to
    challenge players to think outside the box when answering questions.
    It's important to emphasize that the quiz remains unchanged upon
    restarting, and it often presents questions with multiple
    technically correct answers. However, the player must select the
    answer that the quiz designers have specified as correct.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    For instance, in question 7, all four answers are technically
    correct, but the expected answer is "an elephant." In question 12,
    players are expected to click on the smallest circle, and while this
    isn't among the given options, the correct answer is the dot above
    the letter 'i.' This game is intentionally designed to rely on
    players making mistakes and failing, which is a fundamental part of
    the gameplay.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Now, while my game doesn't have real-life implications for
    astronauts or flights, I aim to create an environment that simulates
    such consequences. With this in mind, I initially considered
    adopting "The Impossible Quiz" system. However, I had to reconsider
    this approach because if players failed multiple times before
    answering correctly, it might result in harm to the people they were
    supposed to notify. Therefore, I couldn't base my game on this
    system, as player mistakes should not lead to potentially severe
    consequences in the context of your game.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    To ensure replayability in my game, I've implemented a system that
    randomizes the answers and questions for every round or playthrough.
    This approach sets my game apart from "The Impossible Quiz," where
    the questions remain consistent.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    In my game, I've introduced a random check with three possible
    scenarios:
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    1. The astronauts, air traffic control, and/or telecommunications
    have maintenance, flights, or other tasks happening simultaneously.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    2. The solar flare bursts occur before the above-mentioned tasks.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    3. The solar flare bursts happen after the above-mentioned tasks.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    This approach allows these tasks to act independently concerning the
    game's timer mechanics. It also offers the advantage of dynamically
    determining the difficulty curve through code, rather than having it
    predefined by me. This way, each playthrough of the game offers a
    unique challenge, enhancing replayability and keeping players
    engaged.

  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Reflection:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    My primary challenges for this assignment stemmed from my previous
    coursework. Many of my data visualizations and interactive elements
    were heavily influenced by the work we had covered in class. While
    this provided a solid foundation, I recognized that I hadn't
    explored D3.js to the extent that I should have.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    For this assignment, I set a personal objective to create something
    entirely from scratch, rather than duplicating and modifying
    existing work. This approach, while ambitious, proved to be more
    time-consuming than I initially anticipated. I had to invest a
    significant amount of time understanding the basic capabilities of
    D3.js.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    This learning curve not only consumed time but also limited the
    extent of what I could achieve, as I had to prioritize creating a
    submission within the given timeframe. As a result, I couldn't delve
    as deeply into certain aspects as I would have liked. Nevertheless,
    this experience has provided a valuable foundation for future
    exploration and development in D3.js.

    Blog Post #05 - Data Visualisation, Art, and Representation
  </h3>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Introduction</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Data art and data visualisations play a crucial role in enhancing
    information accessibility, bridging the gap between the technically
    readable yet complex nature of raw data and its effective
    communication to a broader audience. As data is commonly stored in
    various formats such as tables, APIs, CSV files, and databases, the
    challenge lies in transforming this raw data into visually compelling
    and comprehensible representations. This not only facilitates
    communication but also enriches the interpretation process.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Firstly, delving into the “meaning-making process” when examining data
    visualisations and data art, we consider the raw form of data (Kidd,
    2015: 21). Here, the choice of medium for representing data becomes
    pivotal in shaping the audience's understanding. Concrete examples
    will be explored to illustrate the impact of the medium on the
    interpretation of data.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Following this exploration, we will define and deconstruct the
    concepts of data visualisation and data art, examining their unique
    characteristics and roles in the representation of information. The
    subsequent discussion will focus on the relationship between these two
    fields, exploring intersections, similarities, and differences.
    Understanding these distinctions is fundamental to appreciating how
    data visualisation and data art contribute to enhancing the
    representation of the underlying data.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Finally, we will delve into the strategies and ethics of data
    representation, engaging in a debate on how these strategies convey
    information and meaning. This section aims to provide insights into
    the considerations and implications of the choices made in presenting
    data visually. By dissecting these aspects, we aim to uncover the
    nuanced ways in which data is not only communicated but also perceived
    and understood by the audience.

  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">
    The “meaning-making process” (Kidd, 2015: 21):
  </h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    “There is no real connection between how a word sounds or how it looks
    on a page and the thing it describes” (Kidd, 2015: 21).
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    In the absence of accurate and well-presented data visualisations or
    data art, interpreting raw data can be challenging. While it allows us
    to discern what the data is saying, the full extent of its message may
    remain elusive, particularly for those not familiar with the dataset.
    Only individuals experienced in working with the specific dataset may
    grasp its nuances and complexities, emphasizing the inherent
    complexity that raw data presents in its unprocessed form. The
    important factors to note are how data is represented and the
    relationship between the different elements within the same data set.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">
    Example 1 – Bar Graph With No Labels (Please Note I have just created
    these bar graphs using Microsoft Excel for explanation purposes):

  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">
    Example 2 – Bar Graph With Labels (Please Note I have just created
    these bar graphs using Microsoft Excel for explanation purposes):
  </h4>
  <img
    src="../images/Screenshot 2023-11-15 103624.png"
    alt="Blog Page Tablet Wireframe"
    class="wireframe-tab"
    id="gr-two"
  />
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Consider Example 1, where two bar graphs represent the incomes of two
    companies over five years. Initially, Company A appears to have rapid
    growth between the first two and last two bars, with less difference
    between the third and fourth bars. However, without labels, the
    interpretation is incomplete. In Example 2, with labels, we draw
    different and more accurate conclusions. Notably, Company A is
    significantly smaller than Company B, especially considering their
    initial income. The deceptive intervals of Company A’s graph (in
    intervals of 5) compared to Company B's (intervals of 20) highlight
    the importance of accurate data representation.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    To emphasize, employees may not need labels, being familiar with their
    company’s income range and size, while potential shareholders would
    require labels for informed decisions. This example, even if it is
    rudimentary, underscores the notion that “we use what we are given” to
    create meanings and ideas about presented information (Kidd, 2015:
    20). Misleading presentations can hinder our ability to make accurate
    and informed decisions.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">What Is Data Visualisation:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Up until this point, I have provided a brief overview of the
    importance of data visualisations; however, I have not explicitly
    discussed what it is. Data visualisation is a "computer-generated"
    illustration represented in a specific medium to convey certain
    information using different elements in collaboration with text (Li,
    2020: 18). The overarching objective of data visualisation is to
    display necessary data in ways that are easier to comprehend. Examples
    of data visualisations include but are not limited to, "tables,
    charts, trees, maps, scatter-plots, diagrams, and graphs" (Li, 2020:
    22).
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Data visualisation not only aids in understanding the dataset but also
    helps construct meaning, plays a fundamental role in decision-making,
    monitors data, and allows users and developers to identify and analyse
    patterns and trends in the dataset. The general characteristics of
    data visualisation are clear "communication," relevance and accuracy,
    and interactivity (Li, 2020: 22).
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    As demonstrated in the example above, there needs to be clear
    communication between the data visualisation and the user. Considering
    the digital format that these data visualisations take, the developer
    is not always at hand to explicitly state what certain items are or to
    clarify any confusion. Every element necessary to understand the
    visualized data needs to be available in one space. Secondly,
    relevance and accuracy are crucial. Data visualisations should be
    relevant to the theme that the developer is trying to convey, and the
    data should not be skewed or manipulated to sway the user's decision
    in an unethical manner. Finally, what separates analogue charts,
    graphs, etc., from their digital counterparts is the affordance of
    interactivity. This allows for even more engagement for users to
    effectively understand the dataset.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">What Is Data Art:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Data art is a broader concept as it has certain characteristics of
    data visualisation, but to some extent, there is a slight focus on
    aesthetics, narrative, and visual art fundamentals. Viégas and
    Wattenberg describe "artistic visualisation" as the use of aesthetics
    to illustrate data effectively (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007:3). The
    important elements of their discussion are the focus should be on the
    data and not on how it is being represented. Also, the idea that is
    being discussed is about subjective beauty. Data art should not be
    disregarded from the category if it does not fall under the
    conventional understanding of the beauty of images, video games, and
    so on.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Data Visualisation Vs. Data Art:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    I would first like to draw on the similarities of the two data
    representations. Both data representations have the same goal: to
    display a data set in a digital and visual format to make it easier to
    comprehend the data. Communication is a key aspect of both as they are
    attempting to convey the data set to the user in a different way, for
    example, a graph and a video game. Data visualisation and data art
    prioritize the concept of being visually pleasing. The underlying idea
    is to present information in a way that is not only informative but
    also aesthetically appealing, recognizing that a visually attractive
    presentation enhances engagement and comprehension. This allows the
    users to comprehend the data without being bombarded with constant
    text and elements (or parameters in APIs and CSV files). Finally,
    there are storytelling elements in both data art and data
    visualisation.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Secondly, the differences: as Few discusses in a blog post on data
    visualisation vs. data art, in data art, there is a focus on
    “aesthetics and entertainment” whereas data visualisation’s core
    objective is to display data effectively while the aesthetic aspect is
    a secondary objective to enhance the visualisation (Few, 2012). To
    some extent, I disagree with this statement. I do think that there is
    a focus on entertainment when designing video games, animations, and
    other digital artworks but the learning and comprehension is up to the
    audience; in relation to this, people tend to understand better in
    more comfortable environments which these entertaining elements can
    create. Also, depending on the brief or goals set, there is more
    creative freedom with data art in comparison to data visualisations.
    Data visualisation types like graphs and scatter plots are used to
    show progress and development which are more formal ideas and where
    this can be manipulated to fit a game, the need to be more accurate
    and explicit is far greater as there are often greater consequences.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    For example, suppose something is skipped mistakenly in a game. In
    that case, a vast majority of players may not notice until it is
    pointed out to them whereas, if certain statistics are omitted from
    documents, there may be legal consequences. But again, it is dependent
    on intent. As a developer, we are expected to be honest and thorough
    when completing tasks but we cannot deny that mistakes may happen, and
    as a user, we expect to trust the developers who have created the
    work.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Finally, data art has a focus on artistic expression, whereas data
    visualisations focus on analyses to support and either confirm or
    change decision-making processes.

  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">
    Strategies and Ethics of Data Art and Data Visualisation:
  </h4>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Strategies:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    In an article on Exploring Effective Data Visualisation Strategies in
    Higher Education, Zentner, Covit, and Guevarra discuss the different
    strategies tested in an experiment to identify potentially successful
    components of data visualisation. These included the use of colour,
    interactive dashboards, filters, and ranks whether all information
    presented was necessary (Zentner, Covit & Guevarra, 2020). Even
    though, I do think that these aspects were important, it was the face
    value aspects that users will interact with rather than the ideas and
    concepts that developers need to take into account when designing a
    data visualisation. After going through the references, I have
    selected Design Principles for Data Visualisation in Evaluation, as
    Evergreen and Metzner break down the various strategies that they use
    to design a data visualisation: “simplification, legend, data, colour,
    weight, motion, text and arrows” (Evergreen & Metzner, 2013: 6-16).
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Simplification</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    The idea around this is to break down data and display it in its
    simplest form to ensure that there is a clear meaning that the user
    can identify (Evergreen & Metzner, 2013: 6).
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Legend</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    The visualization should be “close to or on the same page” as the
    information it is intended to enhance. This ensures that the user
    maintains concentration throughout their meaning-making and
    understanding process without the “loss of any information” when
    referring back to any information (Evergreen & Metzner, 2013: 8).
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Data</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    As a developer, it's crucial to comprehend the data and streamline it
    to a level where users can readily grasp it with ease (Evergreen &
    Metzner, 2013: 8). Adding information is always good but too much
    information can lead to overwhelming the user or break their
    concentration.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Colour</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    The user should differentiate between important information and less
    important information by their very distinctive colour choices. For
    example, important information will be highlighted in red and less
    important information will be in a light blue. The eye-catching red
    colour will draw the user’s attention (Evergreen & Metzner, 2013: 11).
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Weight</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Visual weight is just as important as “colour contrast” (Evergreen &
    Metzner, 2013: 14). This means that more important elements are shown
    larger.
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Motion</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    As explained above, motion and interactivity are affordances that can
    be used effectively in an online space (Evergreen & Metzner, 2013:
    15).
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Text and Arrows</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    Towards the end of the creation process, identify certain elements
    that were previously considered redundant and find ways to incorporate
    them. The authors emphasise that minimalistic design is important but
    only if it does not affect the user’s understanding. All necessary
    elements such as arrows, text, and so on, should be added if it
    enhances the understanding for the user (Evergreen & Metzner, 2013:
    15).
  </p>
  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Ethics:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    In all forms of communication, both digital and analogue, intention
    will always be a fundamental factor. If developers choose to
    manipulate data for various reasons such as making a profit, defying,
    or altering decisions, spreading propaganda, and so on, there needs to
    be laws in place to ensure that this is limited and there are
    consequences to it.

  <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Conclusion:</h4>
  <p class="blog-txt">
    The intricate interplay between data art and data visualisation serves
    as a powerful means of transforming complex raw data into meaningful
    and accessible information. The "meaning-making process" underscores
    the significance of accurate representation, as illustrated by the
    example of bar graphs. While both data visualisation and data art
    share common goals of communication, aesthetics, and storytelling,
    they differ in their emphasis on entertainment and artistic
    expression. Strategic considerations, such as simplification, colour
    choice, and interactivity, play a crucial role in effective data
    representation, while ethical considerations are paramount to
    maintaining trust and integrity in data communication. Navigating the
    nuances of these concepts and implementing them successfully poses
    challenges, highlighting the dynamic nature of data representation in
    the ever-evolving landscape of information communication.
