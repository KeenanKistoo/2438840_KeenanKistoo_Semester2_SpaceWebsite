          <p class="blog-txt">
            Asteroids NeoWs (Near-Earth Object Web Service) is a NASA (National
            Aeronautics and Space Administration) web service that provides data
            and information about Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). NEOs are a group of
            celestial objects that include asteroids and comets that have orbits
            that come into close proximity to Earth. NEOs are of particular
            interest to scientists and astronomers because of the potential
            impact hazard they pose to our planet.
