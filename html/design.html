        <p class="design-txt">
          I would like to create a website that utilizes empty space effectively
          to convey that the boundless expanse of outer space is a compelling
          concept. I will attempt to use a minimalistic design that is built
          around buttons that allow my user to navigate through my website.

        <h2 class="design-head">Colour Choice</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          I have centred my website around a black, white, and grey colour
          palette with bursts of random colours where necessary. I do believe
          that this is an effective way to illustrate the outer space theme.
          Since the majority of the website will be in black and white, the
          random bursts of colour will draw the user’s attention as all the
          important information and/or data visualisation elements will be
          displayed in this way.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          I like the idea of managing open space to communicate the theme of my
          website. I feel like it gives it its own personality. However, I am
          battling to find the balance between intentional empty space and just
          blank areas across my website. One of the solutions that I have tried
          to implement with this particular iteration, was keeping my
          information central and surrounding it with empty space. I will,
          however, do more research on this and try my best to improve on this.

        <h2 class="design-head">Blog Section</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          My blog section is divided into two parts, almost a split down the
          middle of the webpage. The left-hand side will be a quick-access menu
          to navigate to a specific blog post, and on the left-hand side, there
          will be an illustration of the earth’s rotation around the sun (I will
          go into more detail about this later). I have done this to allow my
          user to have two options for navigation. For a new user, it may be
          interesting to look at the way I have chosen to illustrate my time
          stamps however, there may be occasions where users, new and old, just
          want to get to the blog post. I do not want to frustrate my user at
          any point.

        <h2 class="design-head">Navigation Bar</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          This will be consistent across my entire website. I do feel that this
          is the most effective method of ensuring that the user can easily
          navigate from one place to another. On the homepage, I have opted for
          a tooltip which is activated on hovering over a specific button. This
          is related to the above-mentioned attempt to keep the website with as
          few elements as possible. On the other pages, the tooltip is fixed,
          regardless of whether the user is hovering over a specific button or
          not. I thought this would be a good way to communicate to the user the
          exact point that they are at and what is on the page; almost like a
          quick one-line introduction.
        </p>

        <h2 class="design-head">Navigation Bar Buttons</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          Since the homepage has a black background, I opted to keep the
          background black with white text. I felt that it looked clean and neat
          and allowed me to emphasize the darkness in outer space. When hovering
          over the homepage buttons, they change to a white background with
          black text. This allows the user to effectively differentiate between
          the other buttons and also shows them what is interactable and what is
          not; in addition to this, the cursor also changes to a pointer cursor.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          For the rest of the website, the navigation bar buttons function
          similarly but their appearance differs. The navigation bar on every
          other page has a white background with black text. To indicate which
          page the user is on, the button has a black background. When hovering
          over the buttons, the background changes to grey to show interactivity
          again.

          This provides users with more insight about where they are and where
          they can potentially go. I liked this concept a lot however, it does
          increase the size of my navigation bar by a substantial amount. I do
          really like this idea; however, I do think that there is room for
          improvement.

        <h2 class="design-head">JavaScript Implementation</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          At this point, JavaScript allows me to navigate through my website. I
          spent an unusually long time trying to distribute my navigation bar
          elements using JavaScript as I have done for the previous website
          submission. Even though I was successful with the distribution part, I
          struggled with the DOM manipulation part. I attempted to add an event
          listener to buttons using classes as normal but it was reporting a
          null reference. After multiple checks and attempts, I have pushed this
          aside, for now, to ensure I have all the other elements that my
          website requires first.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          On a positive note, I was able to use a loop to change the tooltip
          text when hovering over each button. This made the process much
          shorter and more efficient. I do think that learning small lines of
          code like this will allow me to speed up certain aspects leaving more
          time to refine my code and improve my user experience.
