        <p class="design-txt">
          I would like to create a website that utilizes empty space effectively
          to convey that the boundless expanse of outer space is a compelling
          concept. I will attempt to use a minimalistic design that is built
          around buttons that allow my user to navigate through my website.

        <h2 class="design-head">Colour Choice</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          I have centred my website around a black, white, and grey colour
          palette with bursts of random colours where necessary. I do believe
          that this is an effective way to illustrate the outer space theme.
          Since the majority of the website will be in black and white, the
          random bursts of colour will draw the user’s attention as all the
          important information and/or data visualisation elements will be
          displayed in this way.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          I like the idea of managing open space to communicate the theme of my
          website. I feel like it gives it its own personality. However, I am
          battling to find the balance between intentional empty space and just
          blank areas across my website. One of the solutions that I have tried
          to implement with this particular iteration, was keeping my
          information central and surrounding it with empty space. I will,
          however, do more research on this and try my best to improve on this.

        <h2 class="design-head">Blog Section</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          My blog section is divided into two parts, almost a split down the
          middle of the webpage. The left-hand side will be a quick-access menu
          to navigate to a specific blog post, and on the left-hand side, there
          will be an illustration of the earth’s rotation around the sun (I will
          go into more detail about this later). I have done this to allow my
          user to have two options for navigation. For a new user, it may be
          interesting to look at the way I have chosen to illustrate my time
          stamps however, there may be occasions where users, new and old, just
          want to get to the blog post. I do not want to frustrate my user at
          any point.

        <h2 class="design-head">Navigation Bar</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          This will be consistent across my entire website. I do feel that this
          is the most effective method of ensuring that the user can easily
          navigate from one place to another. On the homepage, I have opted for
          a tooltip which is activated on hovering over a specific button. This
          is related to the above-mentioned attempt to keep the website with as
          few elements as possible. On the other pages, the tooltip is fixed,
          regardless of whether the user is hovering over a specific button or
          not. I thought this would be a good way to communicate to the user the
          exact point that they are at and what is on the page; almost like a
          quick one-line introduction.
        </p>

      <section class="design-para">
        <h2 class="design-head">Navigation Bar Buttons</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          Since the homepage has a black background, I opted to keep the
          background black with white text. I felt that it looked clean and neat
          and allowed me to emphasize the darkness in outer space. When hovering
          over the homepage buttons, they change to a white background with
          black text. This allows the user to effectively differentiate between
          the other buttons and also shows them what is interactable and what is
          not; in addition to this, the cursor also changes to a pointer cursor.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          For the rest of the website, the navigation bar buttons function
          similarly but their appearance differs. The navigation bar on every
          other page has a white background with black text. To indicate which
          page the user is on, the button has a black background. When hovering
          over the buttons, the background changes to grey to show interactivity
          again.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          At the time of writing, I have realised that I have not grouped my
          navigation bar elements in a list. I tried to simply wrap it now
          however, that alters my CSS code. This is something I need to ix in my
          next iteration.

          This provides users with more insight about where they are and where
          they can potentially go. I liked this concept a lot however, it does
          increase the size of my navigation bar by a substantial amount. I do
          really like this idea; however, I do think that there is room for
          improvement.

        <h2 class="design-head">JavaScript Implementation</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          At this point, JavaScript allows me to navigate through my website. I
          spent an unusually long time trying to distribute my navigation bar
          elements using JavaScript as I have done for the previous website
          submission. Even though I was successful with the distribution part, I
          struggled with the DOM manipulation part. I attempted to add an event
          listener to buttons using classes as normal but it was reporting a
          null reference. After multiple checks and attempts, I have pushed this
          aside, for now, to ensure I have all the other elements that my
          website requires first.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          On a positive note, I was able to use a loop to change the tooltip
          text when hovering over each button. This made the process much
          shorter and more efficient. I do think that learning small lines of
          code like this will allow me to speed up certain aspects leaving more
          time to refine my code and improve my user experience.

          not many d3 built-in functions required to add this to the website so

        <h2 class="design-head">Overall Reflection</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          In terms of my UI and UX, I tried to ensure that there was clear
          communication throughout the navigation. I always made sure that the
          user was aware of where they were and where they were going. So, I am
          happy with this. There are a few changes that I would like to make in
          my next iteration. Sometimes things happen way too fast like colour
          transitions and tooltip activation. I would like to slow this process
          down very slightly to ensure a better user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          I was not happy with my JavaScript implementation. There was quite a
          gap between development which made it difficult to reflect and
          identify mistakes since I had not worked on the code for a period of
          time. I need to start commenting on my code and making notes along the
          way. The issue is that when I find some sort of momentum, stopping to
          make these notes shifts my concentration entirely and I often forget
          what I was initially trying to complete.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          Another mistake that I have made was spending an excessive amount of
          time on something that does not work instead of scrapping the idea and
          starting again. For my navigation bar, I struggled to carry everything
          across and still add event listeners to my elements. I spent almost
          two to three days altering and editing the code instead of starting
          again and finding a more effective way to do this. I need to be more
          efficient and confident when making decisions like this. If I am not
          100% sure it will work, I need to create alternatives to ensure I am
          not pushing other work back.

            This was something that I had previously mentioned as a challenge as
            I tried to complicate it too much. I have now reworked the
            navigation bar to be fixed at the top of my web page. When you are
            at the top of the web page, the navigation bar is expanded, however,
            when you are scrolling down, the navigation bar shrinks slightly to
            allow the body to be focused on. There was also mention of my
            website not being responsive. Honestly, it completely slipped my
            mind in my initial iteration. In this iteration, my navigation bar
            is somewhat responsive. After not interacting with my code for two
            weeks, it felt as if I were reading someone else’s code. For my
            final website iteration, I will need to sit down and go through each
            element step by step.

            being called outside of the DOMContentLoaded event listeners. Since

            Now, I have changed this and everything functions as initially

          <h2 class="design-head">My Experience with the NASA API:</h2>
          <p class="design-txt">
            I initially planned to work with the Kepler Field data and Mars
            weather data that I found. The Kepler Field data available was from
            an external URL and I was concerned about the reliability of this
            website so I have moved over to Solar Flares instead. The Mars
            weather services were no longer tracking the weather on Mars
            therefore I moved over to asteroids instead.
          </p>
          <p class="design-txt">
            For the asteroid API, a lot of data was nested into different arrays
            which were also nested into different arrays. To navigate through
            the layers, I needed to figure out what the requirements were; some
            were strings, others numbers, and some were both. This is where I
            spent most of my time during this iteration. D3’s capabilities
            managed the data easily which was helpful but I did not understand
            how APIs worked and I found just using the functionality
            counterproductive. I sat for hours console logging different query
            parameters and eventually I figured out how to use an API with only
            JavaScript. Thereafter, I moved over to D3 and coded my data
            visualizations.

          <p class="design-txt">
            I have opted for a table and a scatterplot graph for my two data
            visualizations.

          <h2 class="design-head">Table:</h2>
          <p class="design-txt">
            Since this iteration was static, it looks like a flood of
            information that seems all over the place. I have several ideas to
            make my table interactive. For example, have the more intense solar
            flares be highlighted, filter options, and I also have a very vague
            idea for my data art.
          </p>
          <p class="design-txt">
            Ultimately, this is my end goal for this table. I would like to
            allow the user to find the lengthiest solar flare and compare
            whether it is relative to its class or if it is independent of each
            other. I would also like to allow the user to select the start and
            end periods that the API allows for. This will allow the user to
            track how many dangerous solar flares were in our atmosphere over
            different periods.

          <h2 class="design-head">Overall Reflection:</h2>
          <p class="design-txt">
            Please note, I have not improved the meta tags yet. I have noted
            this and it is something I will get into very soon for my next
            iteration. After my struggles with navigating through the API, I
            tried to make as many improvments based on the feedback as possible.
            Th meta tags would have taken more time than I had available.
            Overall, I am happy with what I am going to submit but disappointed
            knowing how much more I could have done. It feels like I scraped the
            surface of everything and stopped before really expressing the data.
            However, I do think that to some extent my passion will be more
            visible in a back-end environment. I really enjoy working with
            JavaScript and the libraries made a lot of the work easier and more
            efficient but when I was using several JavaScript functions and
            methods to break apart the API and really understand it, I found it
            more fulfilling than just typing in a line of code that does it all
            for me. But hey, at least I now know how to work with an API now!
          </p>
          <p class="design-txt">
            In terms of future iterations, I do think that I have to pay more
            attention to detail. I do the foundation well but do not explore
            elements as much as I should. This is reflected in my marks for my
            first assignment as I got the bare minimum but struggled to really
            excel further than that. For example, responsiveness. In my default
            75% standard screen pixel size, I think my website looks really cool
            but change this slightly and some stuff looks very cluttered which
            for users would be really annoying. These small things change the UX
            of my website and I need to start focusing on that if I really want
            to improve moving forward.
