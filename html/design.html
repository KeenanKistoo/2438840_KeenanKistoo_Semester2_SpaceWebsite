          <p class="design-txt">
            I would like to create a website that utilizes empty space
            effectively to convey that the boundless expanse of outer space is a
            compelling concept. I will attempt to use a minimalistic design that
            is built around buttons that allow my user to navigate through my
            website.

          <h2 class="design-head">Colour Choice</h2>
          <p class="design-txt">
            I have centred my website around a black, white, and grey colour
            palette with bursts of random colours where necessary. I do believe
            that this is an effective way to illustrate the outer space theme.
            Since the majority of the website will be in black and white, the
            random bursts of colour will draw the user’s attention as all the
            important information and/or data visualisation elements will be
            displayed in this way.
          </p>
          <p class="design-txt">
            I like the idea of managing open space to communicate the theme of
            my website. I feel like it gives it its own personality. However, I
            am battling to find the balance between intentional empty space and
            just blank areas across my website. One of the solutions that I have
            tried to implement with this particular iteration, was keeping my
            information central and surrounding it with empty space. I will,
            however, do more research on this and try my best to improve on
            this.

          <h2 class="design-head">Blog Section</h2>
          <p class="design-txt">
            My blog section is divided into two parts, almost a split down the
            middle of the webpage. The left-hand side will be a quick-access
            menu to navigate to a specific blog post, and on the left-hand side,
            there will be an illustration of the earth’s rotation around the sun
            (I will go into more detail about this later). I have done this to
            allow my user to have two options for navigation. For a new user, it
            may be interesting to look at the way I have chosen to illustrate my
            time stamps however, there may be occasions where users, new and
            old, just want to get to the blog post. I do not want to frustrate
            my user at any point.

          <h2 class="design-head">Navigation Bar</h2>
          <p class="design-txt">
            This will be consistent across my entire website. I do feel that
            this is the most effective method of ensuring that the user can
            easily navigate from one place to another. On the homepage, I have
            opted for a tooltip which is activated on hovering over a specific
            button. This is related to the above-mentioned attempt to keep the
            website with as few elements as possible. On the other pages, the
            tooltip is fixed, regardless of whether the user is hovering over a
            specific button or not. I thought this would be a good way to
            communicate to the user the exact point that they are at and what is
            on the page; almost like a quick one-line introduction.
          </p>

          <h2 class="design-head">Navigation Bar Buttons</h2>
          <p class="design-txt">
            Since the homepage has a black background, I opted to keep the
            background black with white text. I felt that it looked clean and
            neat and allowed me to emphasize the darkness in outer space. When
            hovering over the homepage buttons, they change to a white
            background with black text. This allows the user to effectively
            differentiate between the other buttons and also shows them what is
            interactable and what is not; in addition to this, the cursor also
            changes to a pointer cursor.
          </p>
          <p class="design-txt">
            For the rest of the website, the navigation bar buttons function
            similarly but their appearance differs. The navigation bar on every
            other page has a white background with black text. To indicate which
            page the user is on, the button has a black background. When
            hovering over the buttons, the background changes to grey to show
            interactivity again.
          </p>
          <p class="design-txt">
            At the time of writing, I have realised that I have not grouped my
            navigation bar elements in a list. I tried to simply wrap it now
            however, that alters my CSS code. This is something I need to ix in
            my next iteration.

            This provides users with more insight about where they are and where
            they can potentially go. I liked this concept a lot however, it does
            increase the size of my navigation bar by a substantial amount. I do
            really like this idea; however, I do think that there is room for
            improvement.

          <h2 class="design-head">JavaScript Implementation</h2>
          <p class="design-txt">
            At this point, JavaScript allows me to navigate through my website.
            I spent an unusually long time trying to distribute my navigation
            bar elements using JavaScript as I have done for the previous
            website submission. Even though I was successful with the
            distribution part, I struggled with the DOM manipulation part. I
            attempted to add an event listener to buttons using classes as
            normal but it was reporting a null reference. After multiple checks
            and attempts, I have pushed this aside, for now, to ensure I have
            all the other elements that my website requires first.
          </p>
          <p class="design-txt">
            On a positive note, I was able to use a loop to change the tooltip
            text when hovering over each button. This made the process much
            shorter and more efficient. I do think that learning small lines of
            code like this will allow me to speed up certain aspects leaving
            more time to refine my code and improve my user experience.

            data on this particular aspect after 2021 so it may be difficult as
            the recency is not available. I will change to a different topic if

            attract users to come to the website more frequently. Also, there
            are not many d3 built-in functions required to add this to the
            website so I felt that it was a good starting point while I am still
            learning the ropes.

          <h2 class="design-head">Overall Reflection</h2>
          <p class="design-txt">
            In terms of my UI and UX, I tried to ensure that there was clear
            communication throughout the navigation. I always made sure that the
            user was aware of where they were and where they were going. So, I
            am happy with this. There are a few changes that I would like to
            make in my next iteration. Sometimes things happen way too fast like
            colour transitions and tooltip activation. I would like to slow this
            process down very slightly to ensure a better user experience.
          </p>
          <p class="design-txt">
            I was not happy with my JavaScript implementation. There was quite a
            gap between development which made it difficult to reflect and
            identify mistakes since I had not worked on the code for a period of
            time. I need to start commenting on my code and making notes along
            the way. The issue is that when I find some sort of momentum,
            stopping to make these notes shifts my concentration entirely and I
            often forget what I was initially trying to complete.
          </p>
          <p class="design-txt">
            Another mistake that I have made was spending an excessive amount of
            time on something that does not work instead of scrapping the idea
            and starting again. For my navigation bar, I struggled to carry
            everything across and still add event listeners to my elements. I
            spent almost two to three days altering and editing the code instead
            of starting again and finding a more effective way to do this. I
            need to be more efficient and confident when making decisions like
            this. If I am not 100% sure it will work, I need to create
            alternatives to ensure I am not pushing other work back.

              at the top of the web page, the navigation bar is expanded,
              however, when you are scrolling down, the navigation bar shrinks
              slightly to allow the body to be focused on. There was also
              mention of my website not being responsive. Honestly, it
              completely slipped my mind in my initial iteration. In this
              iteration, my navigation bar is somewhat responsive. After not
              interacting with my code for two weeks, it felt as if I were
              reading someone else’s code. For my final website iteration, I
              will need to sit down and go through each element step by step.

              Previously, my navigation bar was strictly HTML. Now, JS runs my
              navigation bar. This was always the goal. However, in my first
              iteration, I made a mistake with my code where a particular line
              was being called outside of the DOMContentLoaded event listeners.
              Since I did not find this fault in time, I opted to leave my work
              as HTML. Now, I have changed this and everything functions as
              initially planned.

            <p class="design-txt">
              I initially planned to work with the Kepler Field data and Mars
              weather data that I found. The Kepler Field data available was
              from an external URL and I was concerned about the reliability of
              this website so I have moved over to Solar Flares instead. The
              Mars weather services were no longer tracking the weather on Mars
              therefore I moved over to asteroids instead.
            </p>
            <p class="design-txt">
              For the asteroid API, a lot of data was nested into different
              arrays which were also nested into different arrays. To navigate
              through the layers, I needed to figure out what the requirements
              were; some were strings, others numbers, and some were both. This
              is where I spent most of my time during this iteration. D3’s
              capabilities managed the data easily which was helpful but I did
              not understand how APIs worked and I found just using the
              functionality counterproductive. I sat for hours console logging
              different query parameters and eventually I figured out how to use
              an API with only JavaScript. Thereafter, I moved over to D3 and
              coded my data visualizations.

            <p class="design-txt">
              Please note, I have not improved the meta tags yet. I have noted
              this and it is something I will get into very soon for my next
              iteration. After my struggles with navigating through the API, I
              tried to make as many improvments based on the feedback as
              possible. Th meta tags would have taken more time than I had
              available. Overall, I am happy with what I am going to submit but
              disappointed knowing how much more I could have done. It feels
              like I scraped the surface of everything and stopped before really
              expressing the data. However, I do think that to some extent my
              passion will be more visible in a back-end environment. I really
              enjoy working with JavaScript and the libraries made a lot of the
              work easier and more efficient but when I was using several
              JavaScript functions and methods to break apart the API and really
              understand it, I found it more fulfilling than just typing in a
              line of code that does it all for me. But hey, at least I now know
              how to work with an API now!
            </p>
            <p class="design-txt">
              In terms of future iterations, I do think that I have to pay more
              attention to detail. I do the foundation well but do not explore
              elements as much as I should. This is reflected in my marks for my
              first assignment as I got the bare minimum but struggled to really
              excel further than that. For example, responsiveness. In my
              default 75% standard screen pixel size, I think my website looks
              really cool but change this slightly and some stuff looks very
              cluttered which for users would be really annoying. These small
              things change the UX of my website and I need to start focusing on
              that if I really want to improve moving forward.

              I have still failed to make my website responsive. I think a major
              part of this stems from how often I work with my code. Since there
              are so many CSS styles that I have used across the website, I find
              myself lost within certain elements of the website when attempting
              to make it responsive. I have created wireframes for what I want
              the website to be like before my next submission to ensure that
              the website is responsive. I think that I need to spend some time
              relearning and trying to understand the different styles that I
              used and where are the references. Considering there are over 500
              lines of CSS that I barely worked with in the last month and a
              half this will be a challenging but necessary goal.

                My feedback for my bubble chart suggested that I have not
                accurately used the data visualization type. I have attempted to
                improve on this and add interactivity to effectively communicate
                the necessary information.
              </p>
              <p class="design-txt">
                Initially, the bubble size was based on the absolute magnitude
                which was also the y-axis value. I have changed this to the
                estimated diameter of the asteroids to depict three different
                relevant variables. Now the user can see the brightness based on
                the y-axis, how close to the earth the asteroid was off of the
                x-axis, and the estimated size of the asteroids based on the
                radius of the circles.
              </p>
              <p class="design-txt">
                All of this information is then added to a tooltip to
                communicate the exact values to the user. I have attempted to
                keep a fairly simple tooltip, similar to the ones we did in
                class, as I felt that communicating and clarifying any
                information that was not particularly clear was more important
                than including other insignificant information.

                I have added placeholders by my blog section and visual marvel
                tabs but I am thinking about expanding on solar flares even
                further for my next iteration.

                I just feel like there is so much interesting data within the
                API and I barely scratched the surface of what I could possibly
                do.

                Generally, high-intensity solar flares can disrupt several
                frequency-based technologies. I would like to create a mini-game
                where the user will have to manage different tech to ensure that
                the solar flare radiation does not massively affect the life of
                the devices. It would almost be like a turn-based combat game
                between the user and their inventory and the solar flares.

              <p class="design-txt">
                Ever since I started this course I have always been fascinated
                with inventory management and systems and I would like to merge
                this with turn-based combat mechanics to create a game.

                Solar Flare has a reading of M1.5 close to Southern Africa.
