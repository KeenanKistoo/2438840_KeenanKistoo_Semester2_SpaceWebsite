        <p class="design-txt">
          I would like to create a website that utilizes empty space effectively
          to convey that the boundless expanse of outer space is a compelling
          concept. I will attempt to use a minimalistic design that is built
          around buttons that allow my user to navigate through my website.

        <h2 class="design-head">Colour Choice</h2>
        <p class="design-txt">
          I have centred my website around a black, white, and grey colour
          palette with bursts of random colours where necessary. I do believe
          that this is an effective way to illustrate the outer space theme.
          Since the majority of the website will be in black and white, the
          random bursts of colour will draw the user’s attention as all the
          important information and/or data visualisation elements will be
          displayed in this way.
        </p>
        <p class="design-txt">
          I like the idea of managing open space to communicate the theme of my
          website. I feel like it gives it its own personality. However, I am
          battling to find the balance between intentional empty space and just
          blank areas across my website. One of the solutions that I have tried
          to implement with this particular iteration, was keeping my
          information central and surrounding it with empty space. I will,
          however, do more research on this and try my best to improve on this.

        <p class="design-txt">
          My blog section is divided into two parts, almost a split down the
          middle of the webpage. The left-hand side will be a quick-access menu
          to navigate to a specific blog post, and on the left-hand side, there
          will be an illustration of the earth’s rotation around the sun (I will
          go into more detail about this later). I have done this to allow my
          user to have two options for navigation. For a new user, it may be
          interesting to look at the way I have chosen to illustrate my time
          stamps however, there may be occasions where users, new and old, just
          want to get to the blog post. I do not want to frustrate my user at
          any point.

        <p class="design-txt">
          This will be consistent across my entire website. I do feel that this
          is the most effective method of ensuring that the user can easily
          navigate from one place to another. On the homepage, I have opted for
          a tooltip which is activated on hovering over a specific button. This
          is related to the above-mentioned attempt to keep the website with as
          few elements as possible. On the other pages, the tooltip is fixed,
          regardless of whether the user is hovering over a specific button or
          not. I thought this would be a good way to communicate to the user the
          exact point that they are at and what is on the page; almost like a
          quick one-line introduction.
