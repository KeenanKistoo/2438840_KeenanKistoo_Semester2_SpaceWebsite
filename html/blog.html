          Blog Post #01 - Close Reading: Overview of Data Visualisation
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          This chapter delves into the depth of "The Concept of Data
          Visualization" (Li, 2020: 17). It provides several different
          definitions, or rather, understandings of what data visualization can
          be perceived as. Additionally, this chapter also discusses the
          different forms that we can consider as a visualization of data.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          Each definition differed slightly; however, the central idea shared
          among many was that data visualization is a method of presenting data
          to individuals more efficiently, making it easier to comprehend. When
          looking into this concept further, it is split into two aspects:
          “information visualization and scientific visualization” (Li, 2020:
          19). However, regardless of the division, the data provided needs to
          be illustrated in an effective way to allow individuals to understand
          it. My understanding of this is that even though the language used in
          data sets, spreadsheets, bank statements, and so on, may or may not be
          complicated, the substantial number of values may be difficult to
          understand in their “raw” form (Li, 2020: 19).
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          “Trees” allow data to be displayed to depict importance, structure,
          time stamps, evolution/growth, or any related instance (Li, 2020: 24).
          For example, in Figure 1, there is a clear “hierarchical” (Li, 2020:
          24) flow to the “skill tree” (FIFA 23, 2022). The locked icon of the
          tree that is marked A cannot be unlocked unless a series of other
          branches is unlocked first. The structure is evident and allows the
          user, in this instance, the player, to view their progression
          accordingly. This form of data visualisation is not a conventional
          example like a food chain or a family tree, but it shows progression
          and importance, which is a fundamental concept of this data
          visualisation form.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          “Maps” are scaled illustrations of a particular location (in a
          geographical context) or a representation of an aspect, concept,
          program, or object (Li, 2020: 26). This is a concept that should be
          easy to understand theoretically since we are exposed to so many, but
          still, I struggled to grasp it due to the idea that anything can be
          mapped out. For example, “DNA mapping” and Google Maps are
          fundamentally different however, both can be classified as a form of a
          map (Li, 2020: 26). The difference is that a DNA map uses a
          microscopic scale (this increases the magnification) whereas a map of
          Johannesburg needs to be scaled down to cover the entire space.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          “Tables” allow for information of distinct types to be displayed in
          one space (Li, 2020: 30). I do think that there is a common
          misconception that using tables as a data visualisation form refers to
          an excessive number of values that are all placed within rows and
          columns. Tables can display text, numbers, check boxes, images, and
          any other form of data that needs to be compared between various
          categories. For example, in Figure 2, we see the classes (all the text
          under headings, which one may interpret as the data types that are
          being compared) and their corresponding numerical values, whereas, in
          Figure 3, the numerical values are used to distinguish the data types
          that are being compared and text is the data that is being displayed.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          “Graphs” allow multiple numerical values of a specific or multiple
          category/s to be displayed visually using lines, bars, and so on (Li,
          2020: 34). To some extent, I do think that graphs can be altered or
          “inaccurate” as the individual/s generating the graph can alter the
          scale or axis to suit the strategy that they are trying to achieve
          (Li, 2020: 35); even though the values may be correct, the
          representation of these values may create a false sense of
          understanding by the viewers. It is important to represent information
          honestly and ethically.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          There are attributes inherent in “traditional data visualisations”
          (Li, 2020: 41). The focus of the data visualisation should be on what
          is being displayed and not on how it is being said. The viewer should
          easily differentiate between different values, headings, colours, and
          so on. Yes, graphs, scatter plots, and even maps can be challenging to
          comprehend, however, once the viewer develops a firm grasp of the data
          visualisation form, they should easily read the data. The data
          visualisation should rely on recall and relevancy. It should also act
          as an aid to understanding the data sets.

        <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          During my first attempt at understanding what data visualisation is, I
          found myself confusing the use of art to represent or explain a
          concept with data visualisation. After completing this reading, I do
          think I am in a better position to move forward with my website. When
          planning this blog post, I set out to write fifty words and an
          additional example of each data visualisation form. After actually
          engaging with the reading, various templates, and websites, I found
          myself lost in endless possibilities. I have proceeded to select a few
          data visualisation forms that I am most likely to use during the
          development of my website.

          Blog Post #02 - Critical Reflection - My Proposed UI and UX
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          My overall objective is to create a website that effectively allows
          the user to navigate through it and convey the theme that was set out
          for us. More importantly, I am hoping that with the first iteration of
          this website, I have improved and learned from my previous mistakes.
        </p>
        <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Colour Palette/Choice:</h4>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          I have opted for a black-and-white colour palette with random bursts
          of colour. I believe that these random bursts of colour will draw the
          user to important information and guide them along with my future data
          visualisation additions. At the time of writing, there are no data
          visualisations yet, and my entire website is in black and white.
        </p>
        <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Homepage</h4>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          I tend to put a lot of thought, sometimes too much thought, into my
          homepage and I struggle to find the balance between too little
          information and an unnecessary amount of information. I have opted for
          a very basic homepage and have found the perfect image for what I was
          trying to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          On my website, there is an image of an astronaut looking up giving the
          impression of the astronaut staring at the heading and navigation bar.
          At first, I thought this was a really neat idea but felt it was just
          too little information for the user. The astronaut guides the user to
          where I want them to look first however, the headings provide too
          little information about my website.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          For example, some of the pages on my website are about Mars, The
          Kepler Field, and The Picture of the Day. The headings give an overall
          idea of what will be on the webpage however, it does not specify
          considering the various content that could possibly be about Mars or
          The Kepler Field. I have decided to implement a tooltip that appears
          when the user hovers over one of the buttons (or headings) and gives
          them more information about the page that follows. This tooltip
          disappears when the user's mouse leaves the button. This allows me to
          ensure the clean and uncluttered homepage that I desired but still
          allows the user to gain more information on the website.
        </p>
        <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Navigation Bar:</h4>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          This is consistent throughout my website. I believe that the homepage
          acts as a tutorial of some sort. Keeping this idea in mind, I hope to
          allow my users to identify how my navigation bar works when first
          interacting with it and from that point onwards their navigation
          experience will be easier.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          I do however think that the transition speeds when hovering and when
          the tooltip appears are too quick. It feels more like a flash rather
          than a transition. I noticed this before submission however I could
          not bring my mind to deciding the correct value of time. My idea
          moving forward would be to sit with a few friends and alter the time
          slightly each time and get some feedback; thereafter, I will decide on
          what works best.
        </p>
        <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Blog Page:</h4>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          My blog section is split into two parts. The quick access panel acts
          as a table of contents. For some context, my data visualization idea
          would be an illustration of the Earth rotating around the sun. My
          concern is that this constant motion would become annoying for the
          user. Hence, the table of contents is labelled as a quick access panel
          as I would like to allow the user to have a choice: 1) Interact with
          my data visualization idea to navigate to the desired blog post or 2)
          click on the blog post heading in the quick access panel. Also, I have
          tested the visual illustration with no interactivity and I would like
          to make sure that there is a backup navigation if there are any
          unforeseen errors.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          I have also decided to add all my blog posts on one page. The goal is
          to have everything under one section in one place. For navigating and
          user experience purposes, I do think that scrolling to the top of the
          page to access information would be easier than going back to a
          previous tab. Currently, on my website, there is a flaw with this
          idea: when I add this blog post, the user will need to scroll far up
          to access the access bar or the navigation bar. I would like to either
          add a scroll to the top button on the page and/or have the access bar
          as a slide-out menu to improve the user experience.
        </p>
        <h4 class="sub-head-blog">Design Section/Blog Post:</h4>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          These two sections follow a very simple idea. Heading > Divider line >
          Paragraph. I kept this constant throughout both sections to ensure
          that the user knew how to read everything from experience. The idea is
          to have the user see the heading in a larger font, gain some sort of
          idea as to what they are going to read next, and then read the text
          below. I personally do not like blog pages that are in a
          newspaper/magazine format (with columns, an enlarged first letter of
          the paragraph, etc.), I just feel like a more linear structure is a
          more effective way to communicate thoughts. Once the user reads
          certain information, they can move on from it as it is not slightly
          left of a column divider for example. The planet-themed divider line
          was added to keep up with the theme of the website.
        </p>
        <img
          class="planet-div-line"
          src="../images/div-line-planets-new.jpg"
          alt="Planets Divider Line"
        />
        <h4 class="sub-head-blog">What my website lacks:</h4>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          A footer. I have added this to my code but not implemented it into the
          website. I do think that this allows users who are at the end of a
          page to navigate back to a different page or back to the top of the
          page.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          This brings me to my next point: I would like to add a button that is
          set to active when my user reaches the bottom of the page to return to
          the top of the page.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          I do think that the small additions that make the user's life easier
          are what make a website more likely to succeed. It shows the user that
          the developer cares about their experience and would like to make it
          as smooth as possible.
