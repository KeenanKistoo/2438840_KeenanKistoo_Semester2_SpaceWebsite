          Blog Post #01 - Close Reading: Overview of Data Visualisation
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          This chapter delves into the depth of "The Concept of Data
          Visualization" (Li, 2020: 17). It provides several different
          definitions, or rather, understandings of what data visualization can
          be perceived as. Additionally, this chapter also discusses the
          different forms that we can consider as a visualization of data.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          Each definition differed slightly; however, the central idea shared
          among many was that data visualization is a method of presenting data
          to individuals more efficiently, making it easier to comprehend. When
          looking into this concept further, it is split into two aspects:
          “information visualization and scientific visualization” (Li, 2020:
          19). However, regardless of the division, the data provided needs to
          be illustrated in an effective way to allow individuals to understand
          it. My understanding of this is that even though the language used in
          data sets, spreadsheets, bank statements, and so on, may or may not be
          complicated, the substantial number of values may be difficult to
          understand in their “raw” form (Li, 2020: 19).
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          “Trees” allow data to be displayed to depict importance, structure,
          time stamps, evolution/growth, or any related instance (Li, 2020: 24).
          For example, in Figure 1, there is a clear “hierarchical” (Li, 2020:
          24) flow to the “skill tree” (FIFA 23, 2022). The locked icon of the
          tree that is marked A cannot be unlocked unless a series of other
          branches is unlocked first. The structure is evident and allows the
          user, in this instance, the player, to view their progression
          accordingly. This form of data visualisation is not a conventional
          example like a food chain or a family tree, but it shows progression
          and importance, which is a fundamental concept of this data
          visualisation form.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          “Maps” are scaled illustrations of a particular location (in a
          geographical context) or a representation of an aspect, concept,
          program, or object (Li, 2020: 26). This is a concept that should be
          easy to understand theoretically since we are exposed to so many, but
          still, I struggled to grasp it due to the idea that anything can be
          mapped out. For example, “DNA mapping” and Google Maps are
          fundamentally different however, both can be classified as a form of a
          map (Li, 2020: 26). The difference is that a DNA map uses a
          microscopic scale (this increases the magnification) whereas a map of
          Johannesburg needs to be scaled down to cover the entire space.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          “Tables” allow for information of distinct types to be displayed in
          one space (Li, 2020: 30). I do think that there is a common
          misconception that using tables as a data visualisation form refers to
          an excessive number of values that are all placed within rows and
          columns. Tables can display text, numbers, check boxes, images, and
          any other form of data that needs to be compared between various
          categories. For example, in Figure 2, we see the classes (all the text
          under headings, which one may interpret as the data types that are
          being compared) and their corresponding numerical values, whereas, in
          Figure 3, the numerical values are used to distinguish the data types
          that are being compared and text is the data that is being displayed.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          “Graphs” allow multiple numerical values of a specific or multiple
          category/s to be displayed visually using lines, bars, and so on (Li,
          2020: 34). To some extent, I do think that graphs can be altered or
          “inaccurate” as the individual/s generating the graph can alter the
          scale or axis to suit the strategy that they are trying to achieve
          (Li, 2020: 35); even though the values may be correct, the
          representation of these values may create a false sense of
          understanding by the viewers. It is important to represent information
          honestly and ethically.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-txt">
          There are attributes inherent in “traditional data visualisations”
          (Li, 2020: 41). The focus of the data visualisation should be on what
          is being displayed and not on how it is being said. The viewer should
          easily differentiate between different values, headings, colours, and
          so on. Yes, graphs, scatter plots, and even maps can be challenging to
          comprehend, however, once the viewer develops a firm grasp of the data
          visualisation form, they should easily read the data. The data
          visualisation should rely on recall and relevancy. It should also act
          as an aid to understanding the data sets.

        <p class="blog-txt">
          During my first attempt at understanding what data visualisation is, I
          found myself confusing the use of art to represent or explain a
          concept with data visualisation. After completing this reading, I do
          think I am in a better position to move forward with my website. When
          planning this blog post, I set out to write fifty words and an
          additional example of each data visualisation form. After actually
          engaging with the reading, various templates, and websites, I found
          myself lost in endless possibilities. I have proceeded to select a few
          data visualisation forms that I am most likely to use during the
          development of my website.
